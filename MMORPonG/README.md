decided to build a react app (vite) to start building in 

i figure go modular, so we can easily split concerns and work in parallel


gonna make a dir for `client`, `server`, `shared`

client will be vite + react - front end and that
server will be node + ts + sockets.io -  backend and that
shared will be typescript + types, consts, math stuff, etc

at least thats the current plan


(on main because its all boiler plate atm, will switch to a branch to build components)
